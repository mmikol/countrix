"""The objective: what one six scores on one board.

The default engine's three terms come first (inference.base), unless the
board's BaseWeights are OFF; then the playbook's: limits prune (soft ones
charge), heuristics normalise and weigh, scored constraints add;
assumptions are the agent's. A `when` reading only the enemy, the map and
the world is settled once per board, not once per candidate. A heuristic
guarded on the six's own state is a need: see Objective.score(). The legal
