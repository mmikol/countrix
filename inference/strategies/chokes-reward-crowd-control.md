# Chokes reward crowd control

Where a map funnels both teams into a choke, crowd control decides who gets through it. A stun, a wall or a knockback at a doorway takes a pick out of the fight at the one moment the whole team is committed, and enclosed space leaves nowhere to dodge it. Picks with a crowd-control tool are counted, read on the ground whose chokes or interiors stand 0.5 sd or more above the ordinary map's.
