"""The search: the optimal six under the catalog, players playing optimally.
A Solver is the board's Objective (inference.scoring) on the board's scale
(inference.scale), searched around the locked picks.

    legal_sixes     every shape the queue and the hard limits allow, filled around
                    the locked picks from a per-role pool of released heroes (an
                    announced hero waits) ranked by standing, PARTNER_POINTS for
                    each locked partner (six per role by default); a shape that
                    needs more of a role than the pool holds takes that role's
                    next-ranked heroes, so every legal shape is seated
    sweep           a slice of the enumeration prepared, scored and slimmed. The
                    slices partition the field, so the search splits across
                    processes.
    rank            sorted by score, then tie-break, then names - a total order, so
                    the answer does not depend on how the sweep was split; a
                    field the hard limits refuse whole is repaired first: the
                    swept sixes nearest the limits descend over the roster, one
                    seat at a time, until a six meets them
    refine          local search from the best six sixes and the best of every
                    swept shape: swap any slot for any same-role hero on the
                    roster, keep improvements; bring each of the wiki's synergy
                    pairs into the best sixes and each shape's climbed best two
                    slots at once; then climb from
                    random sixes of the leader's shape and change two seats at
                    once. Which sixes it visits reads no score threshold, so
                    scaling the objective moves none of them
