"""Latest wins: a board a newer request from the same client replaced stops
at its next round instead of holding the pool.

Latest hands a server one ticket per request and client. Each board's
Watch holds its ticket and every task its searches submit; each round of
each search asks it first, and once the ticket is superseded it cancels
the tasks no worker has taken and raises Superseded. A board solved in
this process asks the same Watch, so it stops the same way. The same
cancel_all runs on every other exit of a pooled board, so a board that
raises leaves no task queued behind it.
