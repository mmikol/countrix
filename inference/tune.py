"""Tuning a strategy: an edit to its frontmatter, validated, written back
and logged with its reason. The `tune`, `add_strategy` and `infer_strategy`
tools mirror it into the database, and `derive_strategies` does when it
derived something.

    tune("coverage", "weight", 3.5, "the solver kept leaving Pharah unanswered")
    tune("under-healed", "params.HEAL_MARGIN", 0.8, "two-support lines felt thin")
    tune("anti-air", "when", "enemy.flyers >= 1 and map.known == 1", "...")

    add("shut-off-heals", "Shut off a heavy heal line", "constraint", prose,
        {
            "when": "enemy.heal_ratio >= params.HEAL_RATIO",
            "bonus": "min(team.antiheal, 1) * 1.5", "params": {"HEAL_RATIO": 1.0}},
        "user: one anti-heal pick against a heavy heal line")
    complete("a-draft", {"metric": "team.dps_floor", "direction": "maximize",
                         "weight": 2}, "inferred from the prose")

Fields: kind, category, metric, direction, weight, confidence, when,
require, soft, bonus, penalty (strategy.TUNABLE) and params.NAME. Every
value is checked by strategy.checked_value, the rule the loader reads a
file by, before any file is touched. Each of the three takes a reason and
writes in one order (_commit): the edited (or new) file is loaded through
the catalog before it is written, so a metric that does not exist or an
expression that does not parse is refused and nothing changes. Every
accepted change is one line in inference/strategies/tuning-log.md. The log
lives beside the files: the compose stack bind-mounts that directory, so a
change made through a container lands on the host and in git with the file
it changed.
