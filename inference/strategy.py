"""One strategy: the record a playbook file becomes, its kind and form, and
the rules every file keeps, checked against the facts layer's metric
registry.

    STRATEGIES = CONSTRAINTS ∪ HEURISTICS ∪ ASSUMPTIONS

A strategy file, in the frontmatter dialect (inference.frontmatter):

    ---
    name: Answer every revealed enemy
    kind: heuristic
    category: matchup
    direction: maximize
    metric: team.coverage_share
    weight: 3
    when: enemy.size >= 1
    ---
    prose: what it means and why

The kind is constraint, heuristic or assumption, and either of the first
two takes an optional `when` guard. A HEURISTIC names a numeric fact key
(`metric`), min-max normalised against the board's scale (inference.scale:
a seeded reference sample of legal sixes and the board's field) and
weighted; `direction`, maximize or minimize, says which end is good, and
an optional `confidence` metric scales the weight by how strongly the
premise holds. Guarded on the six's own state it is a need: weight x
(norm - 1). A CONSTRAINT takes one of two forms, read off its frontmatter
(`form`):

    limit   `require: <expr>` must hold. Hard by default - a comp that
            fails is discarded; `soft: true` with `penalty: <number>`
            subtracts instead.
    scored  `bonus: <expr>` and/or `penalty: <expr>`: the solver adds
            `weight x (bonus - penalty)` while `when` holds.

An ASSUMPTION is prose: what the solver takes as given and the /comp
session holds a comp to (players play optimally, say). It carries nothing
to score and is never a draft.

A constraint or heuristic with only a name, a kind and prose - no metric,
no expression - is a DRAFT: it loads, it is shown and served, the solver
ignores it, and the `/strategy` skill infers the rest (a heuristic's
metric, direction and weight; a constraint's limit or bonus/penalty and
params) from the prose and writes it through `infer_strategy` - or turns
it into an assumption when nothing measurable captures it.

`params:` (an indented block of NAME: number) are the dials an expression
reads as params.NAME - tuning is editing the file.

Each field keeps one rule, which FIELDS names and checked_value applies: a
line of text or an expression is one line as the loader splits lines,
within its length cap; a choice is one of its choices; the weight is a
finite number within 0..10; soft is true or false; a param is NAME: a
finite number. The loader reads every file through these checks, every
writer (inference.tune) checks a value by them before a file changes, and
the door declares its strategy arguments from FIELDS.
