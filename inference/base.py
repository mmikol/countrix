"""The default engine: what a six scores before the playbook adds a term.

    base(six) = W_RATE x rates + W_SYNERGY x synergy + W_COUNTER x counters

    rates       each pick's win rate on the map, all ranks (its overall rate
                where there is no map or no row for it), in points over 50,
                times the share of that edge its pick rate earns - p / (p +
                RATE_PICK_HALF), the map's pick rate on a map - and averaged
                over the six
    synergy     team.synergy_score: the wiki's synergy scores among the six
    counters    the counter graph between the six and the other side
                (facts.counters): the weight of the edges by which its picks
                answer that side less the weight of those by which that side
                answers them, a wiki edge WIKI_WEIGHT (2) and, on a pair the
                wiki has no edge on either way, a derived one DERIVED_WEIGHT
                (1). The other side is its locked picks; with none, its likely
                six on this map (compute.expected_picks, past the bans),
                which only this term reads

It is always on and needs no playbook: under a playbook of assumptions the
board's sixes are the ones these three favour, and the strategies' terms
sit on top of it (inference.scoring). A heuristic moves a six by its weight
at most, since its norm is in [0, 1].

Only this term reads the kit's derived edges. The team.* counter metrics -
coverage, exposed_count, net_edges and their family - read the wiki's
graph alone: the playbook's counter rules are written and weighed against
the wiki's judgement, and a derived edge is the kit's reading, at half a
wiki edge's weight here. team.net_edges stays the wiki's edges counted once
each against red's picks; this term is the weighted graph against the side
it reads, another number under another name. The board says which edges
are derived: this term's fact lists each one with the mechanism that fired,
as do the heroes' facts (hero.vs_derived).

The rate term is centred on 50, a coin flip, and not on the reference
sample's mean: the zero is the same on every board, so a six's term needs no
sample and is a function of the six and the board alone; the pull toward 50
for a rarely picked hero shrinks to that same zero; and a comp's share of
the optimal reads as its share of the optimal's edge over a coin flip.

The weights. W_RATE is 1: the rate term is in win-rate points. The other two
are set so that each term's median range within one board is about half the
rate term's, measured over the reference sample (inference.scale.sample,
1,200 legal sixes a board) on each of the 30 maps, each board's other side
its likely six, the side the term reads until one is revealed. The synergy
score's median range is 21 and the counter graph's 42.5 - the wiki's edges
at 2 and the kit's fill at 1 - so each term spreads a typical board's sixes
about 2.1 points. The rate term's own range reads Blizzard's rates, which
are licensed for personal use, so its figures stay out of the repo. These
are defaults, which recorded match outcomes will refit. OFF zeroes all
three, and a board scored under it is the playbook's alone, exactly as
before the engine had a base.
