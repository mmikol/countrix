"""The process pool the board splits its searches across.

CPython holds the GIL for this pure-Python work, so parallelism means
processes: a pool of workers, spawned once and kept - the servers that call
this are threaded, and forking a threaded process is unsafe. A worker exits
within a second of its parent, a kill included. Each search runs in four
rounds, a slice per worker: the reference sample, for the low and high each
heuristic takes on this board; the sample again, scored under those bounds,
for each hero's standing, which ranks the pools, and the board's floor, the
lowest score among those sixes; the enumeration, prepared and scored; then
one worker ranks and refines the merged field. Only verdicts cross - hero
ids, score, tie-break - and slices partition their round, so nothing
depends on how the work was split.

A board runs up to six searches. Blue's and red's go first. A seat's fill
is that seat's board (same map, side, enemies and bans), so it takes the
seat's bounds and standing and draws no sample of its own; the countered
case's two - blue's best counter to red's six, and blue's picks filled on
its scale - follow red's six. A full six is ranked against the field its
seat's search already swept.

Each round first asks the board's Watch (inference.supersede) whether a
newer request replaced the board; the Watch sees every task the searches
submit, so a superseded board's queued tasks are cancelled.

The world crosses as bytes pickled once and cached per worker. Each task
names the playbook folder the parent reads, and a worker reads it again
when the folder or a file in it changes. Off with COUNTRIX_PARALLEL=0 (read
on every board), on one core, or with a catalog the caller supplied (a
worker loads the playbook from its files). The task functions are
top-level, so a spawned worker finds them by module path.
