"""The playbook against the owner's recorded matches: does its score say
anything about who won that the heroes alone do not?

Recorded matches are the second input the owner writes, beside the
strategies. Each is one map (facts.matches.Match): both sixes, the bans,
the map, blue's side, blue's result, and the digest of the playbook in
force when it was played. Blue is always the owner's team.

    guard       the decided maps an effect needs, and the plain words when
                there are fewer
    examples    the decided maps as the models read them, and M4's ablations
    assess      the models fitted and scored out of sample on two splits,
                the ablations, the guard and the verdict -> a Validation
    validate    the pin, the rescore and assess in one call

inference.rescore picks the maps a playbook is judged on and rescores them
through the engine; inference.predict holds the models (M0 a coin flip up
to M4, the heroes plus the playbook score and the matchups), the splits
(older sessions against newer ones, and whole sessions left out) and each
model's log loss and Brier on maps it was not fitted on, with a 95%
interval from resampling sessions. Below the decided maps an effect needs
- (5.6 / b)^2 for b log-odds per sd - the report says so and gives no
verdict. Nothing here writes; the maps are read, never tuned on.
