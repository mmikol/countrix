"""The kit in the format in force, draft.KIT_FORMAT: the wiki's 6v6 figures
laid over the 5v5 rows the kit tables hold, before derive_scalars reads them.

    kit_format.apply(world)

The load reads each hero's 6v6 pools (heroes.health_6v6, shield_6v6,
armor_6v6) and 6v6 lines (kit_6v6) onto the hero, so the facts can say what
6v6 changes. A pool the wiki gives replaces the 5v5 one, and a line that
moves a stat from A to B moves each row of that stat on the piece it names
whose value is A and whose words hold A once: "100 base + 100 per enemy"
holds 100 twice, and a line about the per-enemy part must not move the
base. A line whose A no stat row holds - the 5v5 figure has moved since the
wiki wrote it, or the piece keeps no such row - is left unapplied and said
so, and so is a line with no figure. Every change is kept on the hero as a
KitChange for the facts to word.
