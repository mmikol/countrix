"""The FactSet: a board's facts numbered F1..

A Fact is one sentence and the structured claim behind it (scope, subject,
key, value, unit, source); the FactSet numbers them in emission order and
files each under the metrics it states, so the inference layer finds a fact
by metric and a person reads the same facts as numbered sentences.
facts.board_facts writes a board's facts into one.
