"""The team metrics: every TEAM_METRICS key for a team's picks, and the typed
bag they come in.

team_metrics computes the lot for one side, on a map, facing the other side;
each section of the registry - shape, durability, damage, sustain, tools,
cohesion, meta, map, versus - is one helper that writes its keys once. The
facts engine words the bag, the solver scores it, and compute's registry()
offers its keys to a strategy as team.<key> and enemy.<key>. MetricBag is
the shape every metric section shares, and number, text and the other
readers narrow a value where one kind is read.
