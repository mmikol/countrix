"""A kit piece: an ability, a weapon config or a perk, its stat rows, and the
combat numbers read off them.

db/data/wiki/kits/measurements.py stores each wiki stat as measurements
(value, unit, condition) beside the stat's original value_text. This module
derives a kit piece's combat numbers from both at read time - a reload
worded beside a firing rate, a figure that is a sum and not one hit, a
percent worth its published cap, a row on the hero itself - so a fix to how
a wording is read is a code change here and needs no re-pull. The rest of
the facts package reads the measurements and the keywords, and a stat's
text or an ability's description only where a word or a figure in it
settles a case (counters, scalars, kit_format).
