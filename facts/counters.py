"""The mechanical counter matrix: who answers whom by the kit alone, for every
ordered pair of released heroes, and the counter graph the default engine
reads - the wiki's edges, and the matrix's where the wiki has none.

    counters.derive(world)                  the load runs it after derive_scalars
    counters.weight(world, loser, winner)   2 a wiki edge, 1 a derived one, 0 none

Thirteen mechanisms each read a strength in [0, 1] off the two heroes' kit
facts; one under FLOOR does not fire, and a pair's score is the fired
strengths' sum, capped at 1. A pair's net is its score less the reverse
pair's. Nothing is fitted to the wiki: every constant below is set from the
kit, the wiki's own rules or the game's roles, and the matrix is measured
against the wiki's graph (AUC) afterwards, never tuned to it.

    antiair     hitscan or fast projectiles at range against a light flier
    flyer       a light flier over a hero with little to shoot up with
    barrier     a weapon or tool that passes barriers against a hero whose
                hit points lean on a placed barrier
    antiheal    anti-heal against self-sustain or healing output
    burst       a single hit of half a non-tank's pool or more, full at a
                one-shot; a movement tool's hit is the dash, read as control
    cc          stun, sleep, hack, knockdown or a damaging grab against a
                channel; those, roots and knockbacks against mobility
    eater       a projectile eater against a main weapon it takes
    eaterproof  a main weapon the loser's eater cannot take
    armor       armor against a main weapon of small hits
    dive        a mobile Initiator or Flanker that kills against an
                immobile backliner
    save        invulnerability and cleanse against anti-heal, control and
                big hits
    range       a reach gap past RANGE_GAP against an immobile hero without
                a barrier
    tankbust    sustained damage through armor against a big tank pool

Against a light flier, cc, burst and dive count only as far as the winner's
anti-air reaches.

Three rules are fixed against the research that first derived the matrix.
An eater reads the per-weapon flags of its own family, which the wiki
publishes for two eaters, each named for it - Defense Matrix
(ignores_matrix) and Deflect (ignores_deflect). Javelin Spin, Kekkai
Sanctuary and Kinetic Grasp have none; their descriptions say what they
take, projectiles ("destroy projectiles", "absorbs enemy projectiles"), so
a hitscan, beam or melee weapon passes them whole, where the research read
Defense Matrix's flags for them and counted a hitscan shot eaten. A weapon
that publishes no reach is guessed at what it covers in PROJECTILE_WINDOW,
or MAX_REACH for hitscan, only where the hero's primary fire publishes none
either: where it does, the kit has said how far the hero fights, and a
secondary fire's silence is unknown, not 57.5 m (Mei's Icicle beside the
Endothermic Blaster's 12). The matrix's burst leaves out a movement tool's
hit (Reinhardt's Charge, 300 pinned to a wall): the dash is control, which
the cc mechanism reads, and counting it twice made the charge a one-shot.
Hero.burst, which the team metrics read, keeps it.

The graph. The wiki decides every pair it has an edge on, either way. The
matrix ranks each loser's answers - score at least THRESHOLD, net above 0,
by score, then net, then name - and keeps the first TOP_ANSWERS; of those,
each on a pair the wiki has no edge on counts at DERIVED_WEIGHT against a
wiki edge's WIKI_WEIGHT, so every tally stays an integer. The cut comes
first, so a loser the wiki answers often keeps fewer derived answers.
