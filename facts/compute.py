"""The metrics: pure functions over a World.

Every number the board shows as a joint fact and every number a strategy
can reference is computed here or in facts.team, once - the facts
engine renders these into sentences and the inference layer's solver
scores candidate compositions with the same functions. The registries
(TEAM_METRICS in team; MATCHUP_METRICS, MAP_METRICS and WORLD_METRICS
here) are the vocabulary a strategy's frontmatter may use: `team.<key>`,
`enemy.<key>` (the other side's team metrics), `matchup.<key>`,
`map.<key>`, `world.<key>`; registry() gathers them all.

Unknowns are numeric, never None: a metric that needs a map reads 0 (or
falls back to the roster-wide figure where that is the honest substitute,
which the description says) and `map.known` tells a strategy which.

The map.* metrics read the ground in play: the whole map, or the stage a
board names. A stage changes the terrain a strategy reads (ground), the
objective (map.objective) and map.stage; no team metric reads it.
