# The INFERENCE LAYER - `inference/`

Facts in, the optimal composition out. The layer owns the right-hand
side of the equation in [architecture.md](architecture.md):

```
STRATEGIES = CONSTRAINTS ∪ HEURISTICS ∪ ASSUMPTIONS   the playbook: markdown files in strategies/
COMP       = ARGMAX[ STRATEGIES( FACTS ) ]  the solver searches; the agent argues
```

Two things infer:

- **The solver**: deterministic arithmetic. It reads the strategy files'
  frontmatter, scores every candidate six with the facts layer's metrics,
  and returns the best. No model, no API, and no randomness but seeded
  draws: the reference sample and the refine's restarts. It cannot read
  prose.
- **The agent**: a Claude Code session on the `/comp` skill. It reads the
  same facts and the prose of the same strategies and reconciles them
  where arithmetic cannot. It runs when you ask it to, never on its own,
  on your subscription.

One input is written by hand: the playbook, which the solver reads. A pull
tool fills every other table. The shipped playbook is six assumptions, one
heuristic, `heal-rate`, scored ([The healing floor](#the-healing-floor)),
and one limit, `at-most-three-supports`, while it is rebuilt from the
citations in [inference/README.md](../inference/README.md); the default
engine scores every board beneath it ([The objective](#the-objective)).
The solver tests run on the reference playbook in
[tests/fixtures/playbook/](../tests/fixtures/playbook/), which holds a
file of every form but the draft. The package's map is the
[inference/__init__.py](../inference/__init__.py) docstring, and each
module's docstring holds its detail.

## The objective

The solver maximises one number per six, the default engine's terms
first and the playbook's on top:

```
score(six) = base(six) + the playbook's terms (How a strategy file works)
base(six)  = W_RATE x rates + W_SYNERGY x synergy + W_COUNTER x counters
```

`base` is the default engine, `inference/base.py`. It is always on and
needs no playbook, so a playbook of assumptions alone gets the sixes its
three terms favour, scored and explained:

- **rates**: each pick's all-ranks win rate on the map - its overall rate
  with no map, or no row for it there - as points over 50, times
  `p / (p + RATE_PICK_HALF)` for its pick rate `p` on the same footing,
  averaged over the six. A rarely picked hero's rate rests on few
  matches, so its edge is pulled toward a coin flip; `RATE_PICK_HALF` is set
  so that only the rarest heroes lose more than half their edge. The term is centred on 50
  and not on the reference sample's mean: the zero is the same on every
  board and needs no sample. A score is therefore signed, and a share is
  read from the seat's floor, not from zero ([The share](#the-share)).
- **synergy**: `team.synergy_score`, the wiki's synergy scores among the
  six.
- **counters**: the counter graph between the six and the other side,
  the weight of its answers less the weight of its exposures. A wiki
  edge, from the Match-Up tables or the Strategy sections, weighs 2.
  Where the wiki has no edge either way, `facts/counters.py` derives
  answers from the kits at load: thirteen mechanisms (anti-air, a flier,
  barrier piercing, anti-heal, burst, control, a projectile eater and a
  weapon it cannot take, armor, dive, saves, reach, tank-busting) score
  every ordered pair of released heroes, and each loser's six best
  answers, scoring 0.5 or more and more than the reverse, weigh 1 each.
  The other side is its locked picks, or, with none, its likely six on
  this map past the bans (`compute.expected_picks`, the six the board's
  red panel shows); either seat reads the other the same way. Only this
  term reads the likely six or a derived edge: the `team.*` and `enemy.*`
  counter metrics read the wiki's graph against the picks. The board
  names every derived edge it counts with the mechanism and the numbers
  that fired.

`W_RATE` is 1, so the rate term is in win-rate points. `W_SYNERGY` and
`W_COUNTER` are set so that each term's median spread across a board's
reference sample is about half the rate term's; the module docstring holds
the calibration. A heuristic still moves a six by its weight at most; the
math page says how that compares with the base's spread. Each term is a bar of the breakdown,
with the fact it read: the counter bar's fact names the six it read.

A `BaseWeights` rides the `Brief`, and `infer` and `evaluate`'s `base`,
into every `Objective` and every worker's `Spec`; `base.OFF` turns the
engine off, and a board is the playbook's alone, as it was before the
engine had a base. The board and the MCP tools run `DEFAULT`. The tests
that pin the reference playbook's sixes turn it off. With the engine off
and a playbook that scores nothing, every six ties at zero and a board
reads *unscored*.

## The share

Each seat's optimal six is its 100, and its 0 is the seat's floor: the
lowest score among the reference sixes its scale drew (`Solver.floor`,
the least of the tally `inference/scale.py` keeps over the sample, which
the pool's slices fold in any order to the same number). A comp's share
is its place on that span:

```
share = clamp((score - floor) / (best - floor), 0, 1) x 100
odds  = each seat's share over the two shares' sum
```

A score is signed, since the rate term counts each pick's edge over 50,
so a share read from zero put every six below zero at 0, and against a
six above zero the odds read 100 to 0. The floor puts both seats on a
real scale; a mirror still reads 50 to 50. A best no higher than the
floor leaves nothing to divide, and every comp but the optimal reads
*unscored*.

A comp the limits rule out is not allowed: blue's full six that breaks
one, or picks that no six keeping them completes within the limits (their
fill is then not solved). The fill searches its pools; when they hold no
such six, `Solver.completes` tries the open slots over the whole roster,
up to `COMPLETION_BUDGET` sixes, and only a search that ends with none
rules the picks out. Such a comp carries no score, no share and no odds,
and its breakdown keeps the limits alone; blue's optimal and red's seat
still render. The badge and the strip read `not allowed: breaks <the
limit's name>`, or, where the picks break no limit as they stand, `not
allowed: no six that keeps these picks meets the playbook's limits`. Red's
revealed picks are the other side's facts and are never ruled out.
`evaluate` refuses such a six, the limit named, and `infer` refuses such
picks in the same words.

## How a strategy file works

Drop a markdown file into `strategies/` and it is live: the solver reads
the directory on every call, the board's playbook panel shows it, the
`strategies` tool serves it, and `load_authored` mirrors it into the
`strategies` table. The frontmatter is the whole contract:

```markdown
---
name: Answer every revealed enemy
kind: heuristic
category: matchup
direction: maximize
metric: team.coverage_share
weight: 3
when: enemy.size >= 1
---
# Answer every revealed enemy
The share of revealed enemies at least one of our picks answers...
```

That is the reference playbook's `coverage.md`, cut short. A `#`
comment takes a whole line: after a value, it is read as part of the
value.

| kind | form | frontmatter | what the solver does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| constraint | limit | `require: <expr>`, any threshold it reads under `params:`, and nothing weighted | discards a candidate that fails; never scores |
| heuristic | heuristic | `metric`, `direction` (`maximize` or `minimize`), `weight` | normalises the metric to [0, 1] on the board's scale (flipped for minimize) and adds `weight x norm` |
| heuristic | scored | `bonus: <expr>` and/or `penalty: <expr>`, `weight` | adds `weight x (bonus - penalty)` |
| assumption | | nothing: prose by definition | nothing: the solver takes it as given and the agent holds a comp to it |
| constraint or heuristic | draft | name, kind and prose only | nothing yet: shown and served until `/strategy` infers the rest or turns it into an assumption |

Constraints cut the space; heuristics weigh what is left. A constraint
always holds and is never weighted: it carries no `when`, `bonus`,
`penalty`, `metric`, `direction` or `weight`, and anything weighted is a
heuristic. A rule that should cost rather than forbid is a
scored heuristic, `when: not (<the rule>)` with its `penalty`; `soft:`
is refused, and so is any key that is not a field. A heuristic weighs a
metric or an expression, never both, and takes an optional `when` guard,
applying only where it holds. A heuristic on a metric guarded on the
six's own state (`team.*` or `matchup.*`) is a need: it adds
`weight x (norm - 1)`, so met it costs nothing and unmet it costs its
weight, and the needs on one guard cost `NEED_BUDGET` (2) together at
most. The scale is a seeded
sample of 1200 legal sixes plus the field of each role's top six by the
board's prior (`inference/scale.py`).

A strategy's prose is three sentences at most (`add_strategy` refuses
more): the claim, why and when, what is measured.

Expressions are a whitelist, compiled once and validated against the
metrics registry when the catalog loads: the `team`, `enemy`, `matchup`,
`map`, `world` and `params` sections, arithmetic, comparisons, `and`,
`or`, `not`, `x if c else y`, and `min`, `max`, `abs`, `round`, `len`,
`int`, `float`, `bool`. A key that is not in the registry, or a
`params.NAME` not declared under `params:`, is refused at load, so a typo
never scores silently. A key a section lacks reads 0, and a division,
floor division or remainder by zero reads 0 for that operation alone.
`params:` (an indented block of NAME: number) are the dials an expression
reads as `params.NAME`. Every key a strategy may reference is in the
vocabulary generated at the end of this document.

The solver never infers a formula or a weight from prose; a model does.
The `/strategy` skill turns a name, a kind and up to three sentences into
frontmatter, or into `kind: assumption` where nothing is measurable, and
stores it through `add_strategy`. A file dropped in with only a name, a
kind and prose is a draft, which the solver ignores until `/strategy`
completes it through `infer_strategy`. No API key anywhere.

## How the weights move

The default engine's weights are constants in `inference/base.py`, and no
slider moves them. The board's sliders override a weight for one board -
`weights=<id>:<0..10>` on `/api/board`, `weights` on the `board` tool -
and every result names the weights it was scored under; the board writes
none of them. Three tools write a strategy file - `tune`, `add_strategy`
and `infer_strategy` - each validated through the catalog before it
writes and logged with its reason in `strategies/tuning-log.md`.

## Sustained healing

`hero.hps` is the healing a hero lands on teammates a second, summed over
every teammate each piece reaches and over every piece that runs beside
the others. The caster's own healing is out. `facts/scalars.py` derives
it from the kit rows at load and keeps each piece's share in
`hero.hps_pieces`; `team.hps_floor` sums `hps` over a six.

- **R1 The weapon.** The best healing weapon at its published rate, the
  reload in, onto one target. A beam's heal row sets its rate before the
  hps field (Mercy: 55, where the field says 60).
- **R2 A cast.** Heal per cast x teammates reached / cycle. The cycle is
  the cooldown, and the cooldown plus the duration where the effect is
  held or deployed and the page does not say the cooldown starts on use
  (`HELD`). Of two instant figures under different conditions the smaller
  counts: the larger is conditional (120 at low health).
- **R3 A resource.** A beam that spends energy fires until x% is spent,
  waits out the regen delay and regenerates, at the x that heals most
  (`energy_duty`). A heal that lingers after the beam counts in the off
  time; a refund of the energy is more beam time.
- **R4 Reach.** An area heal counts the teammates the formation puts in
  its radius, at most five.
- **R5 Beside the weapon.** A piece the weapon cannot run beside is out
  (Lifeline ends on primary fire). A channel that holds the weapon takes
  its time off the weapon (the Pulsar Torpedoes lock).
- **R6 Out.** Ultimates, perks, self-healing, overhealth, healing
  amplification (`hero.heal_amp` carries it) and saves with no heal
  figure (Immortality Field, Resurrect).
- **R7 The tick.** Where a heal row's tick disagrees with its per-second
  figure, the tick sets the rate: Wuyang's stream ticks 25 and 50 where
  its rows read 20 and 55.

**The formation.** The six stand spread uniformly over a disk of radius
R = `FORMATION_RADIUS`. With s = r / R, the chance two of them stand
within r of each other is the disk's distance distribution:

```
p(r) = 1 + (2/pi)(s^2 - 1) acos(s/2) - (s/(2 pi))(1 + s^2/2) sqrt(4 - s^2)    s < 2, else 1
around the caster      reach = 5 p(r)
on an aimed teammate   reach = 1 + 4 p(r)
hps                    = sum over the counted pieces of heal x reach / cycle
```

At R = 15, p(12) = 0.426: Crossfade's 18/s on a 12 m radius heals 2.13
teammates, 38.36 hp/s.

**The constants.** Every radius, cooldown, duration and energy rate is
the wiki's. The judgements sit in `facts/scalars.py` beside their pages:

| Constant | Value | Its page and reason |
|---|---|---|
| `FORMATION_RADIUS` | 15 m | the shortest single-target heal range among the supports (Caduceus Staff, Biotic Grasp, Healing Pylon); the wiki gives no fight size. Two teammates stand 13.6 m apart on average |
| `PYLON_UPTIME` | 1/3 | Illari: the pylon lives one 7 s cooldown, then the 14 s destroyed one |
| `TORPEDO_VIEW` | 0.5 | Juno: no target cap; half the teammates past the aimed one stand in front of her |
| `LOCK_NEAR` | 5 m | Juno: the lock takes 0.35 s at 5 m, 1 s at the 40 m targeting range |
| `SPRAY_TARGETS` | 1 | Moira: "all allies in front", width unpublished |
| `FLAIL_CONTACT` | 1 | Brigitte: the Flail lands throughout, as `hero.dps` holds every weapon on |
| `INSPIRE_LOCKOUT` | 1.25 s | Brigitte: Inspire fires on every third 0.6 s swing, once each 1.8 s |
| `EMPTY_WAIT` | 0.4 s | Illari: an emptied bar waits before it recharges |
| `TICK_RATES` | 25 + 50 | Wuyang: the stream's tooltip ticks, the passive one free |
| `ENERGY_REFUND` | 33% | Wuyang: Guardian Wave refunds the stream's resource |

`HELD`, `CASTER`, `AIMED`, `NOT_BESIDE`, `OWN_HEALS` and `BOOSTS` name the
pieces the wiki has no field for. Mauga's Cardiac Overdrive heals the
teammates 50% of the damage they deal: `facts/tables.py` reads that at
the 2-2-2 role-median dps of his five teammates, 94.29, once the roster's
dps is known.

The 6v6 kit as of 2026-09-26:

| Hero | hps | The pieces |
|---|---|---|
| Baptiste | 111.76 | Biotic Launcher splash 94.00, Regenerative Burst 17.76 |
| Juno | 107.59 | Mediblaster 75.28, Pulsar Torpedoes 32.31 |
| Jetpack Cat | 99.18 | Biotic Pawjectiles 87.18, Purr 12.00 |
| Brigitte | 98.36 | Inspire 73.36, Repair Pack 25.00 |
| Ana | 92.72 | Biotic Rifle 83.33, Biotic Grenade 9.39 |
| Kiriko | 81.50 | Healing Ofuda 74.34, Protection Suzu 7.16 |
| Illari | 70.07 | Solar Rifle beam 53.41, Healing Pylon 16.67 |
| Mizuki | 69.79 | Remedy Aura 38.36, Healing Kasa 31.43 |
| Moira | 69.40 | Biotic Grasp 49.40, Biotic Orb 20.00 |
| Lifeweaver | 60.35 | Healing Blossom 56.18, Life Grip 4.17 |
| Mercy | 60.00 | Caduceus Staff 55.00, Flash Heal 5.00 |
| Lúcio | 54.56 | Crossfade 38.36, Amp It Up 16.20 |
| Wuyang | 48.07 | Restorative Stream 41.41 (the wave's refund 3.54 in), Guardian Wave 6.67 |
| Zenyatta | 35.00 | Orb of Harmony 35.00 |
| Mauga | 16.32 | Cardiac Overdrive 16.32 |
| Soldier: 76 | 4.77 | Biotic Field 4.77 |

Every other released hero heals no teammate. `world.hps_bench`, twice
the median support, is 139.87: Illari and Mizuki.

## The healing floor

`heal-rate`, the shipped playbook's one heuristic, scored, holds a six to a
healing threshold set by the kit. It reads `matchup.heal_shortfall`;
`facts/compute.py` computes it and `matchup.heal_need` (`heal_read`,
`heal_need`, `heal_shortfall`), and the board words both in one fact.

The model is a race. A six has a pool P (`team.pool_total`: health,
shield, armor and a form's armor), damage D (`team.dps_floor`) and
healing onto teammates H (`team.hps_floor`, reloads in): an area heal
counts the teammates it reaches and a beam what its resource sustains
([Sustained healing](#sustained-healing)). Each side's damage lays the
same anti-heal k on the other's healing, so blue
loses (D_r - k H_b) / P_b of its pool a second and red
(D_b - k H_r) / P_r. Blue wins the race when red loses the larger share,
and the margin splits in two:

```
margin = [D_b / P_r - D_r / P_b]  +  k [H_b / P_b - H_r / P_r]
          the damage half             the healing half
```

The damage half is 1/`chew_time_ours` - 1/`chew_time_theirs`. The healing
half breaks even when blue heals the same share of its own pool a second
as red heals of its own, and k cancels there. That share times blue's
pool is the need, floored at red's healing in full:

```
need      = max(H_r, H_r / P_r x P_b)
shortfall = max(0, need - H_b) / need         0 when need is 0
charge    = 2 x shortfall                     heal-rate's weight
```

The floor is there because parity alone asks less healing of a smaller
six, and the race never rewards a smaller pool: its margin rises with
P_b. Under parity alone the engine drops a tank to slip under the bar;
the floor stops that. The margin also rises with every support added, so a rule
that maximised healing would drive toward five supports; a floor does not.

**Red as read.** Red's locked picks, and each open slot a role the 2-2-2
(`EXPECTED_SHAPE`) still misses: d_r = max(0, 2 - red's count in r),
spread over the open slots as f = open / sum(d_r), each missing seat at
its role's median pool (`World.pool_medians`, a form's armor in) and a
missing support at half `world.hps_bench`, the median support's healing:

```
H_r = enemy.hps_floor  + f x d_support x hps_bench / 2
P_r = enemy.pool_total + f x sum over r of d_r x pool_medians[r]
```

A red that has shown its two supports reads as two, not as two and a
share of a third. A complete red that heals nothing needs nothing. The
likely six is not read: it rests on pick rates.

**The threshold.** With red empty, red is the 2-2-2 of role-median
heroes: H_r = `world.hps_bench` = 139.87 hp/s and P_r = twice the sum of
`World.pool_medians` = 2 x (525 + 250 + 237.5) = 2025, the 6v6 kit as of
2026-09-26. A six must heal 6.91% of its own pool a second, and never less
than 139.87 hp/s. Everything in it is kit data; no rate enters. The
sources hold no absolute winning threshold - no fight length, no ultimate
charge - so the rule promises parity with the other side's healing and
nothing more. At parity the race is the damage half's, which no shipped
rule prices.

**What it moves.** A six with one support falls under the bar against
any red that heals, so the engine answers with a second support and keeps
a third only where the pair heals little. Within a board the shortfall
mostly follows the support count; the rest is how much the pair heals,
which a count would miss. The weight, 2, sets a six at full shortfall
beside the synergy and counter terms, which each spread a typical board's
sixes about 2.1 points (`inference/base.py`).

**What it inherits.** The bar is only as good as `hps`, and a
World-wide error cancels, since the bench moves with it; an error on one
hero does not. Three limits stand:

- *The bench is a step.* Its median pair, Illari 70.07 and Mizuki 69.79,
  sits with Moira 69.40 inside 0.7 hp/s, each set by a different
  judgement (the pylon's uptime; R and the full aura; the spray's
  reach). One of them past Kiriko lifts the bench to about 151.
- *Overheal is out.* An untargeted area heal lands on full-health
  teammates too, where a single-target healer picks a hurt one; the
  sources give no overheal share, so the rule favours the area heal by
  that margin.
- *Brigitte rests on the Flail.* Her 98.36 holds the Flail in contact
  throughout; at half contact Inspire gives 36.68 and she reads 61.7.

Perks, ultimates, self-healing and health packs are out, on both sides
alike. Over 126,900 uniform random sixes against random reds, a
six with one support is under the floor 90% of the time, with two 39%,
with three 7%.

## The catalog

<!-- generated:catalog -->
8 files in `inference/strategies/`: 1 constraint (a limit), 1 heuristic (0 on a metric, 1 scored) and 6 assumptions. Regenerated by `.venv/bin/python -m door.mcp call db_docs`.

#### Constraints

##### Never more than three supports (`at-most-three-supports`, shape, limit)

`require team.supports <= params.MAX_SUPPORTS` - always holds
params: MAX_SUPPORTS=3

A six fields at most three supports, on every board. Open Queue sets no cap on supports, so this rule sets one: a six with a fourth support is never chosen. Measured as the six's support count.

#### Heuristics

##### Heal at the other side's rate (`heal-rate`, sustain, scored)

weight 2; penalty `matchup.heal_shortfall`

A six heals at least the share of its total health that the other side heals of its own each second, and never less than the other side's healing in full; an unrevealed slot on that side is the 2-2-2 shape's missing role at the role's median pool and healing. With damage anti-heal on both sides, the healing half of the race between the two sixes breaks even at that share, and nothing in the kit sets a higher bar. The charge is the weight times the share of the need left unhealed.

#### Assumptions

##### This is Open Queue Ranked (`open-queue-ranked`, assumptions)

*assumption* - prose the solver takes as given and the session holds a comp to

The mode is Competitive Open Queue, 6v6: six picks per side in any mix of roles under the queue's own limit of two tanks. Rules written for Role Queue's 2-2-2 or for Quick Play do not bind here. Nothing is measured; the shape rules read from this.

##### All players play optimally (`players-play-optimally`, assumptions)

*assumption* - prose the solver takes as given and the session holds a comp to

Every player on both teams plays their hero as well as it can be played. A strategy therefore encodes the game - kits, ranges, cooldowns, maps, roles - and never a lobby's habits or a rank's tendencies. Nothing is measured; the session holds every comp to it.

##### Console only (`console-only`, general)

*assumption* - prose the solver takes as given and the session holds a comp to

The owner plays on console, and the playbook is built for console play. The rates are the console pull, the recorded maps are console maps entered by hand, and no PC-only feature such as the Workshop Inspector log is assumed. Nothing is measured.

##### The rates are a console pull (`console-pull`, uncertainty)

*assumption* - prose the solver takes as given and the session holds a comp to

The pick, win and ban rates the board reads were captured for console play, not PC. A comp is built for console hands, and a PC figure is never assumed in its place. Nothing is measured.

##### Not rank specific (`rank-agnostic`, uncertainty)

*assumption* - prose the solver takes as given and the session holds a comp to

The playbook applies at every rank alike: the rates are the all-ranks figures and no rule turns on a rank. A hero whose value swings by rank is noted as uncertainty, never as a rank's rule. Nothing is measured.

##### Region agnostic (`region-agnostic`, uncertainty)

*assumption* - prose the solver takes as given and the session holds a comp to

The playbook applies in every region alike. The rates it reads are one region's capture, a stated proxy for direction and never for decimals, and no rule turns on where a match is played. Nothing is measured.
