"""A synthetic World: twelve released heroes, four a role, one announced hero
and three maps, built by hand with no database, so the metric, derivation
and board-facts tests work every expected value from the inputs below.

    w = synthetic.world()

Every name and number here is invented. Each value sits where a test needs
one: on a rule's boundary (a 250 hit at range against SQUISHY_POOL, and a
swing over it from a melee-only hero and from one with a gun as well; 30 m
and 25 m hitscan against FLIER_REACH; a map lift of exactly
SPECIALIST_DELTA; a stage's terrain on STAGE_MENTIONS and one mention
short), a flying tank and a flying damage hero, a form's armor, a hero that
heals only off its own damage and one that heals only itself, and a tie
for the last seat of the likely six.

The rates are exact binary fractions, so the arithmetic is exact. A hero's
map rate is its overall win plus a lift per map, chosen so each style's lift
across Harbor Gate, Ember Ruins and Salt Flats reads brawl +2, 0, -2; dive
-2, +2, 0; poke -2, -2, +4 - Flint carries dive and poke, and counts a half
in each.

world() fills the World the way tables.load's reads do, sets heal_bench,
hps_bench, pool_medians and ult_cap as inputs, then runs what load runs after
its reads, in its order: derive_rates, derive_best_maps, the terrain, the
stages' terrain, the styles and the ultimate cap. derive_scalars does not run: there
are no kit rows, so a hero's kit numbers are given whole.
