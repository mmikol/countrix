"""Record a board per released hero that seats it, for the reach test.

Runs inference.reach.search for every released hero, in name order, on the
built database, the playbook in force and the default engine, and writes the
boards it finds to tests/fixtures/reach.json beside that playbook's digest and
the engine's stamp (inference.base.stamp). Minutes of solving in one process.
Run from the repo root, as a module of the tests' package; pytest does not
collect it, and test_reach.py runs it on the synthetic World:

    .venv/bin/python -m tests.inference.record_reach

It prints the heroes no board seats, each with the gap it fell short by, so
UNSEATED in tests/inference/test_reach.py can be checked against them.
