"""Every hero is the right pick somewhere: the objective may make a hero rare, never
impossible, and the heroes the search seats nowhere are named. tests/fixtures/reach.json
records, per released hero, the board inference.reach.search seated it on (a tool:
`reach`), within the five bans a match has, beside the objective that seated it - the
playbook's digest and the default engine's stamp;
`.venv/bin/python -m tests.inference.record_reach` re-records it, and every released hero
is on file or named unseated.
Rates move daily and the two databases differ, so a few boards may tip; a hero that falls
off its board, or is on neither list, is searched for again, and none may be lost. The
search itself, and the recorder, run on the synthetic World."""
