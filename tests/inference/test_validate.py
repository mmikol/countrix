"""The validation: planted effects are found by the model that can see them
and pure noise by none, the guard withholds a verdict below the maps an
effect needs, the time split never trains on a later map and the sessions
split never splits a session, a playbook is judged only from its digest's
first map, the families file every scoring strategy once, an ablation drops
exactly its family's terms, and the rescore is the engine's evaluate from
both seats. No database: the synthetic World and synthetic matches."""
