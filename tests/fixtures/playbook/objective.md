# What the score is

For every candidate six, the solver computes the same team, enemy and
matchup metrics the board shows as facts, then sums: each heuristic's weight
times its metric normalised to [0, 1] against a fixed reference sample of
comps for the board (flipped for minimize), plus each scored heuristic's
weight times its bonus minus penalty while its condition holds. Limits
prune before any of that, and are never weighted. An assumption is prose
alone - the session reads it, the board shows it, nothing is scored.
STRATEGIES = CONSTRAINTS ∪ HEURISTICS ∪ ASSUMPTIONS; the score is
STRATEGIES( FACTS ), and 100 on the board is the best six the solver found.

To tune, change a file through the `tune` tool: raise a weight, add a
`when`, turn a threshold under `params`. The catalog is validated on load -
a metric name that does not exist is an error, not a silent zero - and
`db_docs` regenerates the catalog in docs/inference.md from the files.
