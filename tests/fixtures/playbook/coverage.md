# Answer every revealed enemy

How many revealed enemies at least one of our picks answers, from the
counters table. The single strongest lever the database
holds: a comp that answers all six has a plan for every fight, and one
that answers two is hoping the other four misplay.

Weighted highest because, under the optimal-play assumption, unanswered
enemies do not misplay.
