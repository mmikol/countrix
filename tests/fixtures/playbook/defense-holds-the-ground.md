# Defenders hold ground

On the defending side the geometry is yours: deployables (turrets,
walls, lamps) and barriers make a choke expensive to cross, and reach
lets the comp chip the approach before the attackers can commit.

Judged from the kits, like its attacking twin, and weighted the same:
enough to tilt a close call between two comps the heuristics rate alike,
never enough to override coverage or cohesion.
