"""The daily refresh: the database and the strategies mirror brought up to
date on a schedule.

    python -m door.refresh              run daily at COUNTRIX_REFRESH_AT
                                        (05:00 by default, container time);
                                        refresh right away first if the
                                        cached pages are older than

    python -m door.refresh --once       one refresh, then exit 0, or 1 if it fails

A refresh comes in two sizes. The DAILY one refetches what moves day to
day - the wiki's seasons (a snapshot is stamped with the season live that
day) and the rates - then re-mirrors the strategies. The FULL one is
`sync_all` with refresh on: every page of every source, including the hero
pages and the wiki articles (kits, synergies, counters) that only change
with a patch; it runs when the wiki cache is older than
COUNTRIX_REFRESH_FULL_DAYS (7). Either way a page that fails keeps its
cached copy, so a flaky source degrades to yesterday's numbers rather than
an empty table, and the pull's reply lists it under stale: its first line,
which the log keeps, ends with the count, and sync_all's with the pulls
that read one. The `refresher` container runs this loop.
