"""The owner's recorded matches through the door: record_match, which checks
a played map and stamps the playbook in force before it stores it,
list_matches, newest first, and delete_match, for a map entered wrong. One
record is one map: both sixes - the six on the field longest - the bans,
the map, blue's side and blue's result. Blue is always the owner's team.
The matches are the second input a user writes, beside the playbook, and
carry its `user` source.

A match is checked as the board checks a board, then as only a played map
can be. The names resolve through World.resolve, the board's resolution:
known heroes, released, one seat a team, no banned hero picked. The Draft
refuses a team past six and more than five bans. check_match adds six a
team, at most two tanks a team, and a side given on a sided map and left
empty on any other.
