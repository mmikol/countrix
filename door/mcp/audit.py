"""The audit log: one JSON line per tool call, through either transport and
in-process - when, over which transport, from whom, which tool, the shape of
its arguments, whether it succeeded, and how long it took. COUNTRIX_AUDIT
moves it, read on every call.

Every line names its caller: stdio:<pid> (the process that launched the
stdio server), http:<address>/<session>, and in-process the board, the
refresher, the shell, or nested:<tool> for a call one tool makes to
another. An argument is recorded by name with its length (a string, a
list, an object) or its type name (anything else: int, float, bool,
NoneType) - never its value. A request the HTTP door turns away before
any tool runs is a line too: no tool, under http:<address>, the key the
door's rate limit counts by, refused with its status and reason.

A line that cannot be written is noted on stderr - never stdout, the stdio
wire - and never raised: the door stays open if the log fails.
