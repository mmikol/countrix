"""The database's life: which database the tools point at and how ready it
is, creating, migrating and rebuilding it, the CSV mirror, the generated
docs, and read-only SQL against it.

db_rebuild drops every table, and the owner's recorded matches are the one
thing in them no source can give back. It keeps them: written to
KEPT_MATCHES before the drop, written back by name once sync_all has
refilled the roster, each under its own id, and the file removed when every
one is back. A rebuild that fails leaves the file for the next one, and a
playbook that does not load refuses the rebuild before anything is dropped:
sync_all mirrors it only after every pull, when the tables are long gone.

query is the one tool that runs a caller's SQL. It is guarded twice: the
statement is checked before any connection opens (one read-only statement,
no function that reaches a file or a server), and it runs as the reader
role, which can SELECT and nothing else, in a read-only transaction under a
timeout. A reply carries at most MAX_ROWS rows within MAX_QUERY_BYTES, and
says when it left rows out.
