"""The database's life: which database the tools point at and how ready it
is, migrating and rebuilding it, the generated docs, and read-only SQL
against it.

db_rebuild drops every table. A playbook that does not load refuses the
rebuild before anything is dropped: sync_all mirrors it only after every
pull, when the tables are long gone.

query is the one tool that runs a caller's SQL. It is guarded twice: the
statement is checked before any connection opens (one read-only statement,
no function that reaches a file or a server), and it runs as the reader
role, which can SELECT and nothing else, in a read-only transaction under a
timeout. A reply carries at most MAX_ROWS rows within MAX_QUERY_BYTES, and
says when it left rows out.
