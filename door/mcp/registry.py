    REGISTRY, tool   the one registry, and the decorator a family declares
                     each of its tools with
    Context          where a call lands: the database, the page caches, the
                     log, a refresh's cutoff and the registry; call() is the
                     in-process call, by which one tool calls another
    REFRESH          the refresh argument of every pull and of the rebuild

A family module - pulls, lifecycle, facts, solver, playbook - declares
its tools with @tool and imports no other family. A tool's family is the
module its function is defined in, so the registry lists the same order
whichever family imports first; a decorator that registers a wrapper gives
it its function's module with functools.update_wrapper. tools.py imports
every family. A tool declares its arguments in schema.py's JSON Schema
vocabulary (Properties), the one every call is checked against, and
answers a schema.ToolReply.
