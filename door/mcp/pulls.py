"""The data layer's own tools: pull, clean, store, one tool per source and
domain, then the strategies mirror and the whole sync.

Every pull_* tool is pull -> clean -> store for one source and domain: that
domain's run() in its source package under db/data/, handed a PullContext
over the source's page cache. The pulls are registered in dependency order,
and sync_all runs them in it. A session, the refresher or a shell
(`.venv/bin/python -m door.mcp call`) decides what to pull and when, and reads
the summary back.
