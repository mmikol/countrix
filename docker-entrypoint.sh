#               behind the migrations (the first build scrapes the sources;
#               the mounted caches make later builds cheap), then serve every
#               MCP tool on 8020
#   inference   INFERENCE ENGINE: wait for the database, serve on 8019
#   ui          the board: wait for the database, serve it on 8017
#   refresh     the door's clock: wait for the database, then refresh it
#               daily (door/refresh.py)
#   sentry      the guard: the playbook, the database's text and the door, every
#               COUNTRIX_SENTRY_EVERY seconds (door/sentry.py)
#
# Anything else is run as a command in the image:
#   docker compose run data python -m door.mcp call sync_all
#   docker compose run data pytest -q
