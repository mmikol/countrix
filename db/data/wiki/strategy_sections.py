"""A hero article's ==Strategy== section: the counters its sentences state,
and which way each runs.

The Match-Up column says what one hero does against one enemy, cell by
cell. The Strategy section is prose about the hero, and a sentence may name
several heroes - enemies, allies, heroes it is compared with - so a hero is
read into an edge only by its place around a cue. The article's hero is the
sentence's own side: its names, its pronoun (he or she, as its article uses
it, where the sentence says no "you"), "you" and "your", and, as the one who
acts, its abilities' names; "an opposing Juno" in Juno's article is a
mirror, and no side. Every other released hero named is a foe. A cue's
object is the first hero named after it past three short words at most
("nullify anything Doomfist wants", "stun and kill you"); a list runs on
from a named hero through commas, "and", "or" and two words at most
("Winston, Roadhog, unshielded Reinhardt, and a flying Pharah").

    act         "counter(s) to", "counters", "interrupts", "cancels",
                "nullifies", "denies", "negates", "punishes", "used
                against", "effective against": the hero's own side as the
                object - the foes before it answer the hero (or the foes
                after, where none come before: "counter you (such as with
                a mobile tank like Winston)"); a foe as the object, the
                hero or nothing named before - the hero answers its list;
                no object, the hero or nothing named before - the hero
                answers the first list after ("Pharah is a good counter to
                enemies ... that can't hit her in the air, such as Reaper,
                Mei, Junkrat").
    hit         "stuns", "prevents", "stops", "kills", "eliminates",
                "destroys", "beats", "shuts down", "takes out", "picks
                off": as act, but only with an object - these words are
                nouns too ("Stuns, such as those from Roadhog") and an act
                with no object says nothing of whom.
    avoid       "Try to avoid Sombra": a foe as the object and no foe
                before - its list answers the hero; the hero's side as the
                object ("to avoid your Scrap Gun") - the foes before
                answer it.
    patient     "vulnerable to", "weak to", "easy target for", "countered
                by", "suffers from": the hero, or nothing named, before and
                a list after - they answer it; foes before and none after -
                the hero answers them ("Targets like Mercy and Zenyatta are
                vulnerable to well-executed attacks").
    threatens   "the hero's counters", "your biggest threat", "a threat to
                you": every foe in the clause answers the hero.
    strong      "troublesome", "dangerous for", "poses a threat",
                "difficult to deal with": the foes before answer the hero.
    weak        "vulnerable", "an easy target", "has trouble", "struggles",
                "easy to kill": a list it names at once ("vulnerable
                targets like Mercy", "vulnerable (such as a lone
                Widowmaker)"), or foes before, are answered by the hero, and
                so is the list after where nothing is named before; the
                hero before and a list after "with", "by" or "for" answer
                it ("easy to burst down with heroes like Widowmaker").

A cue is read inside its clause - a sentence splits at ";" and at "but",
"while", "though", "although", "however", "whereas" and ", as well as" - and
not at all after a negation six words back at most ("they don't have the
burst damage needed to kill you") or a "from" ("preventing any stuns from
interrupting Deadeye"). A sentence that hedges ("may seem like
simple counters") or compares ("Like Widowmaker, Hanzo ...") reads no edge.
One that speaks of allies (synergy, ally, friendly, teammate, paired
together), or sits under a bullet that does ("Tidal Blast synergies:"),
reads only a foe it calls an enemy or opposing. A pair a sentence names
beside a cue that reads no edge, or reads both ways within one article, is
ambiguous and dropped; so is a pair two articles' sections read opposite
ways.
