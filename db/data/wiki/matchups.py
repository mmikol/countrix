"""Pull + clean + store: overwatch.fandom.com - hero match-ups.

Every hero article's "Match-Ups and Team Synergy" section has, per other
hero, a Match-Up cell: advice to the article's hero about that enemy, in
either markup matchup_tables.py reads. A cell becomes a verdict from the
article hero's seat: +1 the hero answers the enemy, -1 the enemy answers
the hero, 0 neither.

    1   The wiki's MATCHUP or VS. rating decides: STRONG is +1, WEAK is -1,
        EVEN, NEUTRAL, MEDIUM and MIRROR are 0. A range ("EVEN -> WEAK")
        that averages under one step leaves the prose to decide.
    2   Otherwise the prose is scored. The article hero's name becomes
        "you" and the enemy's "foe"; he and she go to the one whose article
        uses that pronoun of its hero. Each cue adds its weight: whole
        in the first sentence, less in each later one, a fraction in a
        concession ("While ...,"), reversed at half weight after a negation.
        A RISK rating is one more cue. A PRIORITY TARGET rating is kill
        order, not a verdict. A margin under MARGIN is 0.

A tank's article rates each damage and support hero on the PRIORITY TARGET
and RISK scales and never on the MATCHUP one: whom to kill first and how
dangerous it is to try, not who wins. So the label is no answer, and the
prose decides (test_wiki_matchups holds Doomfist's article on Sierra:
HIGH PRIORITY TARGET | LOW RISK, and no edge).

A pair both articles speak about keeps its edge when they agree or one
says neither; when they contradict there is no edge. The same articles'
Strategy sections are read too (strategy_sections), and each of their
edges is stored beside the Match-Up ones under its own basis, with the
sentence that states it. `counters` is reloaded wholesale: one row means
countered_by_id answers hero_id, read in the part of the article its
basis names.
