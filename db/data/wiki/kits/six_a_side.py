"""A hero article's 6v6 kit: what the wiki says changes when the game is
played six a side.

The Cargo table publishes the 5v5 kit. The article carries the 6v6 one
beside it: the infobox's health6v6, shield6v6 and armor6v6, and a
6v6_details field in an Ability_details block, a bullet a change ("Cooldown
increased from 7 to 8 seconds.", "No longer shares a cooldown with Projected
Barrier."). parse_six_a_side reads both off the wikitext the kits pull
already fetched; with_stats names the stat each line moves, from the piece's
own Cargo rows. A value that should be a figure and does not parse is
rejected and named, never stored: an infobox pool that is not a whole
number, a "from A to B" line whose A or B is not a number.
