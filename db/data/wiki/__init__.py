"""overwatch.fandom.com - the Overwatch Wiki: page to table.

Page to table, each ends in run(connection, pull):

    heroes          hero kits via the Cargo Abilities table: weapons and
                    firing configs, abilities, perks, stats, keywords; the
                    announced heroes. kits/ reads and stores its kits
    maps            maps and game modes from the Maps article, each
                    map's stages from its own article, the Hybrid
                    phases from the Hybrid article
    terrain         the ground each map article describes - chokes,
                    interiors, high ground, flanks, sightlines, open ground,
                    hazards, cover - counted per map and per stage
                    (pull_terrain, after maps)
    matchups        who answers whom (counters), from each hero article's
                    Match-Up column and its Strategy section
    patches         game versions from the Patches cargo table
    playstyles      the team-composition playstyles (dive, brawl, poke)
    synergies       pairs that work together, from the same section's
                    Synergy column

The heroes pull's kit pipeline, no run():

    kits/           each hero's kit: read from its Cargo rows and its
                    article, its stats and weapons parsed, stored

The readers the loaders share, no run():

    markup          reading the wiki's two markups - Cargo's rendered HTML
                    and article wikitext - and the tidying both need
    strategy_sections   a hero article's Strategy section: the counters its
                    sentences state and which way each runs; matchups reads it
    matchup_tables  a hero article's Match-Ups and Team Synergy section:
                    one column of its tables as rows, in either markup,
                    and a cell as plain text; synergies and matchups read
                    it, over the released heroes' articles it fetches

The article HTML sits behind a bot challenge; the only open path is the
MediaWiki endpoint below, which returns JSON (Cargo) and raw wikitext and
rate-limits. This module is that client, run on db.data.cache's request
loop and page cache at the pace of its two policies (CARGO_POLICY,
ARTICLE_POLICY), and the `sources` row its pages become.
fetch_articles is how a pull reads one article per entity: an article that
will not fetch is recorded by name and the rest are read.
