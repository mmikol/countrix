"""Fetching: the page cache, its freshness and the request loop, shared by
every source.

    cached_get       one page, from the cache if it is there and fresh
    cached           the cache sequence every reader runs through: the fresh
                     copy, else what it produces, else the stale copy
    request          one page asked for under a RequestPolicy and handed to
                     a reader; a failure is retried while attempts remain
    RequestPolicy    a source's attempts, backoff, timeout and pace
    is_stale         whether a cached page is older than the max_age it is
                     given, or was written before the cutoff
    cache_key        a request as a file name in the cache
    session          a requests session that identifies this project
    PullContext      what a pull's run() takes beside its connection: the page
                     cache, the session, the log (stderr unless the caller
                     names another - over stdio, stdout is the MCP wire) and
                     the freshness. With neither max_age nor cutoff a page
                     is kept forever (a build from the caches); a refresh's
                     cutoff, the moment it began, refetches every page
                     written before it, so the pulls of one refresh fetch a
                     shared article once. A page that fails to refetch
                     keeps its cached copy and is listed in the context's
                     stale, so a flaky source degrades to yesterday's
                     numbers, never to an empty table, and the pull says so

Each source package (blizzard, wiki) names its own endpoints
and its own `sources` row, so provenance lives with the source. Fetching
yields raw markup; reading it is the package's job.
