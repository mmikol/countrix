    normalizer    matching hero, map and ability names across sources

Each fetched source's domain module ends in a run(connection, pull) - pull
a cache.PullContext: the page cache, the session, the log and how old a
cached page may be - that returns a PullSummary: the tables it wrote, and
for a pull that reads one article or page per entity, the ones that would
not fetch (ArticlePullSummary). A run() fetches every page before its
first write, so no row stays locked across a fetch.
The MCP pull tools (door/mcp) import and call them. Nothing here is an entry
point of its own.
