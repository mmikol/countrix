"""Matching names across sources: two keys, for two different problems.

    name_key      a hero or map name across sites. The roster and map pool
                  carry names as Blizzard and the wiki write them - "Lúcio",
                  "D.Va", "Soldier: 76", "King's Row" - and the wiki's
                  links and templates write them other ways: "Lucio",
                  "DVa", "Soldier76".
                  The differences are all punctuation and accents, and a
                  name that fails to match is not a loud failure but a row
                  silently dropped, so the key folds a name down to its
                  letters and digits (accents decomposed and stripped, not
                  turned into spaces: "Lu io" would match nothing). Scoped
                  to heroes and maps, where no two differ only by punctuation.
    hero_key      name_key through RENAMED, for a source that may still
                  write a hero's former name
    RENAMED       {former name_key: current name_key}
    ability_key   an ability name across Blizzard and the wiki, which
                  disambiguate differently: "Void Accelerator (Omnic Form)"
                  against "Void Accelerator", "Eject! (D.Mon)" against
                  "Eject!". Drops one trailing parenthetical and folds case;
                  always scoped to one hero, so the looser key cannot
                  collide across heroes.

    index               a {name: id} lookup rekeyed by name_key
    unaccented          a name with its accents dropped: "Lúcio" -> "Lucio"
    slug                a hero's slug as Blizzard's links write it:
                        "Soldier: 76" -> soldier-76, "D.Va" -> dva
