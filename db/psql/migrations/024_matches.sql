-- MATCHES: the games the owner plays, recorded by hand, the second input a
-- user writes beside the playbook. The owner plays on console, so a game is
-- entered through the door's record_match - the board's record tab, the
-- /record skill - never logged by the game. One row is one map. Nothing
-- here is pulled: every row carries the `user` source, as the strategies
-- do.
--
-- 009 recorded the match that followed a recommendation and 014 dropped it;
-- these tables record what was played, whatever the board said. 027 drops
-- them again: recording games is no longer a feature.
BEGIN;

-- The owner's recorded games, one row a map, written by record_match. blue
-- is always the owner's team, so side and result are blue's: side is attack
-- or defense on an Escort or Hybrid map and '' on a map without sides,
-- result is win, loss or draw. played_on is the day the map was played.
-- playbook_digest is catalog.playbook_digest of the playbook in force when
-- the match was recorded, so a reader can tell which rules the board scored
-- under. note is the owner's own line, '' when there is none.
