-- 010: STRATEGIES = CONSTRAINTS ∪ HEURISTICS
--
-- The playbook - inference/strategies/*.md - held two kinds of file here
-- (013 added the third, ASSUMPTION, and retired prose constraints). A
-- CONSTRAINT was then a limit (`require`, hard unless soft) or a scored
-- adjustment (`bonus`/`penalty` while `when` holds), and a HEURISTIC weighed
-- a metric; since, a constraint is a limit that always holds, and the
-- scored adjustment is a heuristic's form.
-- The table that mirrors the files is `strategies`, so the name means one
-- thing: what were "constraints" and "strategies" are constraints now, and
-- what were "goals" are heuristics.
--
-- The operator's free-form notes (the old `strategies` table, loaded from
-- db/data/authored/strategies/) are gone: a note that matters is written as a
-- prose constraint in inference/strategies/, where it is tuned and logged
-- with the rest of the playbook.

DROP TABLE strategies;

-- The mirror of the playbook: one row per markdown file in
-- inference/strategies/ - its kind (constraint | heuristic | assumption, the last added by 013), the frontmatter
-- a machine scores by (metric, direction, weight, expressions, params) and
-- the prose body a person argues with. Reloaded whole by load_authored so a
-- recommendation can cite the ids it was scored under; the files remain the
-- truth.
