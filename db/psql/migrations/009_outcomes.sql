-- OUTCOMES (history): the match that followed a recommendation - one row
-- per played match with the result, the map, blue's side and, in
-- outcome_picks, both sixes and the bans; a fit read them to nudge the
-- weights toward the metrics that separated wins from losses.
--
-- Superseded: 014 dropped both tables - nothing learns from played matches
-- now (the backlog's "Recorded matches, playbook validation and learned
-- weights" is the way back). The file stays as the sequence's record.
