"""The DATA LAYER, and the base every layer stands on.

`data/` and `psql/` are the layer itself: pull, clean, store. db/ is the
bottom of the import graph and imports nothing above it: the door (door/)
drives the pulls through its tools, and the facts and inference layers read
the tables over db.psql.default_dsn().

    data/         the sources, one package each (blizzard, wiki), and what
                  they share: the page cache (fetch) and name matching
                  (names). Page to table.
    psql/         the database: where it is and the helpers every writer
                  needs (psql), the schema, the ledger, rebuild and the
                  generated docs (psql.schema), the migrations, and the
                  embedded cluster a local build creates (gitignored)
    web           what the three HTTP servers share: the Host-and-Origin
                  guard, the handler that sends and logs, the reply to a
                  request that raised (a Refusal 400, anything else 500 with
                  its traceback on stderr) and the one JSON reader
    matches       the one writer of the owner's recorded matches, by id:
                  the door's record_match, delete_match and db_rebuild call it
    raw/          the CSV mirror the tools export (gitignored)

This file holds what the whole layer must agree on: where things live (ROOT
and the paths under it), the shape of a `sources` row (Source), the roles
the roster pull stores in role_id order (ROLES), the ability and perk
vocabularies the migrations seed (ABILITY_KINDS, PERK_TIERS), the scope
every rates snapshot is pinned to, the one error a caller can fix
(Refusal), which every layer raises and every door answers as the caller's,
where a progress line goes (Log) and the stderr writer a pull, a Context
and the MCP server default to (to_stderr), the hour every age is read in
(SECONDS_PER_HOUR), and embed, which rewrites one generated section of a
markdown file for every layer that generates docs.
docs/db.md walks the tree.

Every row carries a source_id, and that is the only distinction drawn
between what was measured, what was judged and what was written by hand.
Two inputs are written by hand, the strategies and the matches the owner
records: no other table carries the `user` source.
