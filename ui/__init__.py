"""The board: the page over the facts layer's facts and the inference
layer's answer, and the validation report. It is the only presentation
code, and no layer imports it.

    board.py    the board's server: its settings, its JSON endpoints over
                the facts and the inference layer, and the handler that
                routes to them and to the pages
    pages.py    the board's HTML - the page shell, styled like the game's
                hero select, the math and tests pages - and the static files
                they load
    static/     what the browser loads: the stylesheet, the scripts, the
                display font and its licence, math.html and tests.html
    validation  the validation report: `python -m ui.validation` judges a
                playbook against the recorded matches, prints the text and,
                with --out, writes a page of charts, for the owner's own use
    charts      the report's charts as inline SVG: intervals against 0, the
                hero effects, the calibration and the score difference
