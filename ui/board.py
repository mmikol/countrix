"""The board: a map selector and a red and a blue roster, organised and
styled like the game's hero select, over the facts layer and the inference
layer.

    python -m ui.board            # serves http://localhost:8017

http.server and psycopg, no web framework, no build step. This module is
the board's server - its settings, its JSON endpoints and the handler that
routes to them and to the pages ui/pages.py renders. Every click re-reads
the database: the facts panel is the FactSet for (map, side, red, blue, bans);
the comps panel is the inference layer's board - red's most likely starting
comp, blue's picks filled and its optimal counter to red's, each seat's
picks scored as a share of its own optimal, the fight odds and the game
plan; the playbook panel is the strategies catalog as it sits on disk; the
record panel is the board as a played map, ready to record. JSON endpoints
under /api/ serve the first three; /health is the engine's - the playbook
and the database - for the container's healthcheck and orchestrator.py.

The board writes twice, each a door tool call, and only when
COUNTRIX_READ_ONLY=0: a weight stored from the playbook panel is a `tune`,
a map recorded from the record panel a `record_match`.

A request whose Host or Origin names another server is refused with 403
before it is routed (db.web's guard; --allow-host adds a name the board is
published under). A request that raises is answered by db.web.failure: a
Refusal 400 with its message, anything else 500 with its type and message,
the traceback on stderr. A service behind the board - the inference service,
the MCP door - that fails or does not answer is a 502, by db.web's relay
map. Every board solved, and every request that fails, leaves a line on
stderr.
